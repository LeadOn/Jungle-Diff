# Node 24 is the current LTS line. The previous image pinned 23.6.1 — an odd-numbered release that
# never had long-term support and is now end-of-life, so it stopped receiving security patches.
# The major is pinned rather than the patch, so rebuilds pick up Node security fixes automatically.

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# `npm ci` rather than `npm install`: it installs exactly what the lockfile pins and fails if the
# two disagree, so the image cannot silently drift to different dependency versions between builds.
# `--ignore-scripts` is deliberately NOT used: Nuxt's postinstall (`nuxt prepare`) is required.
RUN npm ci

COPY . .

# `nuxi prepare` runs after all sources are copied so tsconfig.json carries the right aliases for the
# Nuxt 4 `app/` directory before the build.
